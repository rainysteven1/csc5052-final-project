## Default Workflow

Two-agent state machine applied to every issue labeled `workbuddy`. Humans
author issues with a `## Acceptance Criteria` section; agents decide
transitions by modifying issue labels via `gh issue edit`. The state machine
only reacts to label changes — it doesn't care whether a human or an agent
changed the label. Bug vs feature distinction lives in optional `type:*`
classification labels, not in separate workflows — the execution path is the
same either way.

```yaml
states:
  developing:
    enter_label: "status:developing"
    agent: dev-agent
    transitions:
      - to: reviewing
        when: labeled "status:reviewing"
      - to: blocked
        when: labeled "status:blocked"

  reviewing:
    enter_label: "status:reviewing"
    agent: review-agent
    transitions:
      - to: done
        when: labeled "status:done"
      - to: developing
        when: labeled "status:developing"

  blocked:
    enter_label: "status:blocked"
    # no agent runs; waits for a human to rewrite the issue
    # (typically adding a proper `## Acceptance Criteria` section)
    # and flip the label back to status:developing.
    transitions:
      - to: developing
        when: labeled "status:developing"

  done:
    enter_label: "status:done"
    action: close_issue

  failed:
    enter_label: "status:failed"
```

`failed` 仍然是 workflow schema 中可识别的终态 label，但当前 Go runtime 不会在 retry 超限时直接写入
`status:failed` 或 `needs-human`；它只记录 retry/failure intent，后续 label 写回仍由 agent 或人工执行。

### State graph

```
         ┌──────────── blocked ◄──── (dev: missing criteria)
         │                │
         │      (human rewrites issue)
         ▼                │
    developing ◄──────────┘
         │  ▲
         │  │ (review: any criterion fails; retry, max 3)
         ▼  │
     reviewing ──► done (all criteria pass; close_issue)

Dev agent: reads `## Acceptance Criteria`, produces the artifact, flips to
reviewing (or to blocked if criteria missing).
Review agent: verifies each criterion against the artifact, flips to done or
back to developing.
Any revisit of a state — including developing↔blocked — counts toward
max_retries; exceeding the limit will record retry/failure intent.
```
